 > **Welcome to My Digital Garden!**

I invite you to this space filled with HyperText, where I share my thoughts and lessons learned, exploring the interaction between technology and humanity.

**I'm a developer who enjoys continuous learning and technological advancement.** I immersed myself in Apple's world, so starting my career in iOS development. But also I'm deeply interested in the progress of Bitcoin, AI and Spacial Computing. Believing that technology can contribute to the advancement of civilization, I hope my efforts can help progress in these areas.

**I'm passionate about writing code that is easy to maintain and highly productive.** To achieve this, I embrace the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) in my projects. Code simplicity and scalability are values I hold dear.

**My motto is "Goal, Plan, Execute."** It reflects my approach to tackling challenges and achieving success in both personal and professional endeavors.

**Wansook is my nickname.** It's a nickname my friends gave me when I was younger because my name is Wansik in Korean. I like the nickname because my favorite food is eggs (in Korean, "Wansook Egg" refers to a fully boiled egg).

This blog is a place where I record and share what I learn and experience. I hope to engage with you in sharing knowledge, exploring new ideas, and envisioning the future of technology.
